TCP Socket Server/Client for Arithmetic Operations

This repository contains a simple TCP socket-based server/client system implemented in Python. The system allows a client to connect to a server, send a message containing two values and an arithmetic operation, and receive the result of the operation from the server.
Features

    TCP Socket Communication: Utilizes TCP protocol for reliable data transmission.
    Arithmetic Operations: Supports basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) between two numbers.
    Simple and Robust: Easy to understand and extend for educational purposes or further development.
